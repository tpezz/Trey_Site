## Hi, I‚Äôm **Trey Pezzetti** ‚Äî 

### Nice to meet you! I am passionate about AI, sports, and innovation. My day job involves exploring how the PGA TOUR can leverage AI, and I also spend a lot of time brainstorming new ways to integrate [Break The Webs](https://www.breaktheweb.co/) data with LLMs. Here's what I'm currently working on:
